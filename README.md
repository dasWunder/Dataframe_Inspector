# Dataframe Inspector

**Data Inspector** is a modular Python utility designed to streamline data exploration, preprocessing, and basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) workflows. It is intended as a learning and prototyping tool for working with pandas DataFrames and Series in an efficient and reproducible manner.

## Module Structure

functions/

1. init.py
2. summary.py # Data overview functions (head, info, types, etc.)
3. preprocessing.py # Missing values, duplicates, and basic cleaning
4. eda.py # Exploratory visualizations (distribution, correlation, etc.)
5. validators.py # module with custom validators

## Tests
During the initial stage tests are conducted in .ipynb file called "Module tests.ipynb". ```TODO: rewrite tests into pytest later```

## Features

- Quick summary of datasets: head, info, type overview
- Basic missing values diagnostics
- Duplicate detection
- Initial plotting utilities (distribution, scatter, boxplot, etc.)
- Clean, modular design — easy to extend and maintain
